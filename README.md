# The Web Scrapper

> This project is from [Microverse](https:microverse.org) main curriculum.

In this project, I created a web scraper of a linux distribitions website [distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/), and I displayed the result based mostly
on the ranking and the popurality of a linux distro.

- [RUBY](https://www.ruby-lang.org/es/)

- [httparty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty)
- [rubocop linter](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/ruby)
